# ICMP-ping
Implementing the ICMP ping to pinging servers of different continents in Python.

I have analysis IMCP protocol via Wireshark but yet to implement it from scratch. 
I really enjoy this assignment; I hope to implement IP and TCP protcol in the future. 
Majority of the code was given; see ICMPping.pdf file. I did not do the optional exercises in this assignment.
